# Btn Opt Testor Record

## Testor Phase 1: Requirement Summary

- Test target: improve light-theme readability for the bottom Tab bar and major interactive controls without changing routes, auth, or storage contracts.
- Out of scope: backend changes, storage/schema changes, navigation redesign, or new feature flows.
- Key assumption: fixes should come primarily from shared tokens and existing palette consumers, with dark theme only receiving non-regression adjustments when shared surfaces require it.

## Executable Acceptance Conditions

1. In light theme, all four Tab labels and icons remain readable in both active and inactive states.
2. In light theme, the login CTA surfaces and profile preference/logout controls do not present low-contrast text/background combinations.
3. Dark theme retains at least the prior level of readability for tabs and main CTA surfaces.
4. The implementation continues to consume palette/token values rather than introducing scattered hardcoded button colors.

## Scenario Matrix

| Scenario | Type | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Light token pairs meet minimum contrast targets | Automated | `apps/mobile/tests/theme-contrast.test.ts` |
| Light login CTA rendering compiles after token updates | Automated | `pnpm build`, `pnpm test` |
| Tab shell compiles with adjusted token values | Automated | `pnpm build`, `pnpm smoke` |
| Manual light-theme walkthrough across login, tabs, profile | Manual smoke | `tests/smoke/README.md` |
| Manual dark-theme regression walkthrough for login, tabs, profile | Manual smoke | `tests/smoke/README.md` |

## Recommended Automated Checks

- `pnpm --filter @creator-cfo/mobile lint`
- `pnpm --filter @creator-cfo/mobile typecheck`
- `pnpm --filter @creator-cfo/mobile test`
- `pnpm lint`
- `pnpm typecheck`
- `pnpm test`
- `pnpm build`
- `pnpm contract:check`
- `pnpm smoke`

## Manual Smoke Focus

1. Start the mobile app in light theme and verify the login skip CTA, guest CTA, Apple button, Tab labels/icons, profile pills, and logout button are readable.
2. Switch to dark theme and repeat a focused regression check on the same surfaces.
3. Toggle language while on the profile screen to ensure text length changes do not reintroduce low-contrast or clipped CTA states.

## Testor Phase 2: Execution Report

### Scope

- Covered code paths: light theme tokens, login CTA foreground/background pairing, focused/inactive tab styling, and palette-driven database demo CTA surfaces.
- Covered evidence types: automated tests, typecheck, lint, build, contract check, turbo smoke.
- Not covered in this round: human-run device or simulator visual smoke.

### Cases and Results

| Case | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Light/dark token contrast assertions | Passed | `apps/mobile/tests/theme-contrast.test.ts`, `pnpm --filter @creator-cfo/mobile test` |
| Mobile lint | Passed | `pnpm --filter @creator-cfo/mobile lint` |
| Mobile typecheck | Passed | `pnpm --filter @creator-cfo/mobile typecheck` |
| Monorepo lint | Passed | `pnpm lint` |
| Monorepo typecheck | Passed | `pnpm typecheck` |
| Monorepo test | Passed | `pnpm test` |
| Contract check | Passed | `pnpm contract:check` |
| Web export build | Passed | `pnpm build` |
| Turbo smoke | Passed | `pnpm smoke` |

### Defects

- No automated blocking defects remained after final fixes.
- Manual visual verification is still pending, so subtle runtime appearance issues are not fully ruled out.

### Smoke Conclusion

- Automated smoke: passed.
- Manual smoke: pending.
- Recommendation: run the updated light/dark contrast checklist in `tests/smoke/README.md` on device or simulator before final closure.
